# 99Cats!

99cats is a web application that allows users to register and list their cats for rental. With 99cats, users can easily browse through a variety of cats available for rental and request to rent a cat for a specified period of time. Users can also list their own cats for rental to other users. The user-friendly interface makes it easy for users to search for and request the rental of their desired cat. This project was developed while studying at AppAcademy.
